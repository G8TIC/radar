Installation as a service
=========================


1. Introduction
---------------

The 'radar' feeder normally runs as a background service - it connects to
whichever ADS-B system you have and forwards data to the 1090MHz UK aggregator.


2. Operating Systems
--------------------

This radar feeder should comnile and operate on most Linux systems from Raspberry
Pi3 to large Interl systems using Systemd or tradional SysV-init.


3. Working assumptions
----------------------

Some working assumptions include:

  1. You have a resonally modern Linux OS
  2. You have build-essential and git installed
  3. You have basic networking tools incuding dig
  4. You have basic OS tools like lsof

if not then run 'make prepare' which will install them by doing:

   apt-get install build-essential git dig lsof net-tools


4. Installation
---------------

Copy the latest tarball on to your system.

Use the following commands to unpack, compile, install and setup:

    tar zxf radar-0.xx.tar.gz
    make prepare
    make
    make install
    make setup


Setup will try work out:

    1. Whether your DNS is working

    2. What protocols your dump1090 supports

    3. What init system you have

and try and do the "right thing"(tm)
